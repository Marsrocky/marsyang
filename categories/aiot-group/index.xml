      <description> I am interesed to supervise the following PhD topics:
 Deep learning for smart sensing and affective computing Transfer learning and domain adaptation algorithms for robust data-efficient sensing Multimodal learning for IoT sensor fusion and their applications  The students should have basic knowledge on statistic learning and deep learning, and be familiar with Python programming. Pytorch library is highly preferred in our research team.
